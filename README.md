# Recogneyes

Recogneyes addresses the challenges faced by visually impaired individuals when trying to recognize faces. It aims to support individuals facing challenges in social interactions or name recall by enhancing memory recall and helping maintain meaningful connections.

This project was made in under 24 hours as part of Cornell's 2024 BigRed//Makeathon and won 2nd Best Overall.

## Purpose

The purpose of Recogneyes is to:

- Empower visually impaired individuals to navigate social situations confidently.
- Aid in name memory retention and recall.
- Enhance independence and enrich daily interactions for its users.

## Technology

### Software

Recogneyes employs computer vision algorithms to conduct real-time facial recognition. It also generates auditory feedback using speech-to-text and text-to-speech technology.

### Hardware

The glasses are powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 microcontroller connected with a Pi camera.

## Figma Prototype

This is an app prototype that serves as a companion to the Recogneyes glasses. Users can configure their profiles, add friends and family to their network, and utilize additional features.
